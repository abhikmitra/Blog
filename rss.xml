How exciting! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, I have been building distributed systems in Dot Net. As a result, I live in the Microsoft ecosystem bubble of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Service Fabric&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Azure DevOps&lt;/code&gt; , etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With DotNet being open source and cross-platform, .NET core should work with all the OSS tech out there. This series will look at how we can build a DotNet app, make it talk to some of the leading OSS frameworks and build a polyglot app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I want to do all of this without using anything from the typical dot net ecosystem other than the language itself. That means no Azure, no service fabric, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary aim for this series is for me to learn and some how documenting what I learn helps me grok things easily. Hope, some of you might benefit from this as well. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
