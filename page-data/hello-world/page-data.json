How exciting! </p>\n<p>For the last few years, I have been building distributed systems in Dot Net. As a result, I live in the Microsoft ecosystem bubble of <code class=\"language-text\">Azure</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Service Fabric</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Windows</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Azure DevOps</code> , etc. </p>\n<p>With DotNet being open source and cross-platform, .NET core should work with all the OSS tech out there. This series will look at how we can build a DotNet app, make it talk to some of the leading OSS frameworks and build a polyglot app.</p>\n<p>And I want to do all of this without using anything from the typical dot net ecosystem other than the language itself. That means no Azure, no service fabric, etc.</p>\n<p>The primary aim for this series is for me to learn and some how documenting what I learn helps me grok things easily. Hope, some of you might benefit from this as well. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World - Starting a new Blog Series","date":"April 13, 2020","description":"Hello World!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/dotnet-app1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Dot Net Core outside MS ecosystem - 1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/durable-task/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Durable Task Framework Internals"}}}}}
